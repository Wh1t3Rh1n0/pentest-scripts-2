## merge-hashcat.py

```
merge-hashcat.py
----------------
Matches passwords cracked with hashcat to their usernames.

Usage: merge-hashcat.py <user:hash file> <hash:password file>

Notes: The "hash:password" file is created by hashcat's -o option.

       The "user:hash" file is easy to create using your original hashdump and
       the "cut" command. An example of creating this file from hashes dumped
       from a Windows domain controller follows:
       
       cat raw_dump.txt | cut -d ':' -f 1,4 > dumped-users_hashes.txt

```

## trufflehog-json2csv.py

```

    ./trufflehog filesystem --json $PWD/input-files/ | tee trufflehog.json
